Task 9: Write a function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.

Task 10: Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

Task 11: Write a function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.

    Prototype: void print_to_98(int n);
    Numbers must be separated by a comma, followed by a space
    Numbers should be printed in order
    The first printed number should be the number passed to your function
    The last printed number should be 98
    You are allowed to use the standard library

Task 12: Write a function that prints the n times table, starting with 0.

    Prototype: void print_times_table(int n);
    If n is greater than 15 or less than 0 the function should not print anything
