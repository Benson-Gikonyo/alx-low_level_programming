0x0C. C - More malloc, free

Task 0: Write a function that allocates memory using malloc.

    Prototype: void *malloc_checked(unsigned int b);
    Returns a pointer to the allocated memory
    if malloc fails, the malloc_checked function should cause normal process termination with a status value of 98

Task 1: Write a function that concatenates two strings.

    Prototype: char *string_nconcat(char *s1, char *s2, unsigned int n);
    The returned pointer shall point to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains s1, followed by the first n bytes of s2, and null terminated
    If the function fails, it should return NULL
    If n is greater or equal to the length of s2 then use the entire string s2
    if NULL is passed, treat it as an empty string

Task 2: Write a function that allocates memory for an array, using malloc.

	Prototype: void *_calloc(unsigned int nmemb, unsigned int size);
	The array created should contain all the values from min (included) to max (included), ordered from min to max
	Return: the pointer to the newly created array
