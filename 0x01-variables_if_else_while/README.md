Task 0: Given a random number, complete the program to check if the number is greater than, less than or equal to zero. The outputs should be Positive, negative or zero respectively for each test.

Task 1: Given a random number, complete the program to check if the last digit of a random number n is greater than 5, less than 6 and greater than zero, or is equal to zero. 

Task2: A program to print the alphabet in lowercase.

Task 3: A program to print the alphabet in lowercase, then in uppercase.

Task 4: A program to print the alphabet in lowercase, except q and e.

Task 5: A program to print all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0.

Task 6: Same as Task 5, but this time, without using type char variables.

Task 7: A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, in reverse, followed by a new line.

Task 8: A program that prints all numbers of base 16, followed by a new line.

Task 9: print all possible combinations of single digit numbers, in ascending order, separated by a comma and space, followed by a new line.

Task 10: create a program that prints all possible different combinations of 2 digits, separated by a comma and space, in ascending order.

Task 11: print all possible combinations of 3 digits separated by a comma and space. Digits must be individually different, in the smallest possible combination, and in ascending order.

Task 12:  print all possible combinations of two 2 digit numbers numbers range from 0-99. 1st and 2nd combination is separated by a space, and then by a comma and space from the 2nd combination. Each digit is individually different; the combos in the smallest possible form and in ascending order.
